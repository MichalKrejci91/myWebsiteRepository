            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
              Hello, I'm <strong>Sslithranox</strong>, or Michal (though I strongly prefer my pseudonym), born in 1991. Since childhood, I've been enjoying both
            imagining various monsters and reading about wildlife (especially reptiles and dinosaurs).
            I have a degree in landscape ecology, which, when thinking retrospectively, probably wasn't the best idea.
            </p>
            <p>
              In recent years, I've taken interest in programming. So let's see where that takes me.
            </p>
            <p>
              I consider myself a cat lover, though I'd like to have some pet reptiles in the future (alongside with kitties, of course!).
              I'm not a sociable person - when it comes to interaction, I prefer to be with one person rather than in a larger group. Not to mention that I am often pretty awkward and there's never
              enough ways for me to embarass myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              When drawing, I seek inspiration in wildlife, both present and past. For example: my dragons are usually a mashup of monitor lizards, crocodiles & their ancient relatives,
              and large theropods.
            </p>

            <h2>About this website</h2>
            <p>
              When I first played with the idea of creating my own website, I almost immediately knew what type of site it would be.
              It would become a place for me to put and display my content, a place where people can see what I have to offer - as both an artist and a programmer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, I want it to be a sort of a progress record. I will continuously update and shape this page as I learn new ways of programming and design.
            </p> <br>
